D stuff in C++
=============

Just for fun/learning; not for production

I thought it'd be interesting to try and implement some D primitives in C++ for the learning experience. Should provide a greater appreciation of what exists in D and what the limitations are in C++.

The content may or may not work. It may or may not be efficient. You're better off using D.

Some content (std_oversights and unittest) is duplicated from my mex repository for convenience.
